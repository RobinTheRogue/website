# About

Kids on Computers (KOC) is an all­-volunteer organization registered in Colorado since 2009 as a 501(c)(3) non­profit organization. We set up computer labs in low-income schools using both donated and new hardware. We equip the computers with free and open source software and educational content that is accessible without Internet access. Although the computers can be used to teach software development, the primary purpose of our computer labs is to support learning of traditional academic subjects.

Many children born in underprivileged or impoverished areas of the world are severely restricted in their ability to improve the quality of their lives. Despite the best efforts of dedicated teachers, primary school does not prepare the children to compete for livelihood in a technological world. Lack of computer literacy is a serious disadvantage when pursuing advanced education or even gainful employment. Consequently these children may, like generations before them, grow to adulthood in poverty and with only the barest education. It’s not their fault or even their school’s fault, but the circle of poverty continues regardless.

Kids on Computers® is a registered 501(c)(3) non-profit, charitable organization based in the state of Colorado, U.S.A.. It is staffed entirely by volunteers, having no paid officers or staff. Most of our volunteers currently have (or formerly had) careers in technology related fields. Members of the Board of Directors are elected annually and are chosen from among the active volunteers per KoC’s Bylaws.As a registered charity, Kids on Computers® is eligible to receive deductible charitable contributions.Kids on Computers is a proud partner of the Linux Foundation and Choice Humanitarian, and is grateful for the support from Yahoo, HP, and all of our other sponsors.
